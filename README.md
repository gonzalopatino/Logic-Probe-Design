# üîå Logic Probe Project

**Designed and Developed by Gonzalo Patino**

---

## üìã Project Overview

The **Logic Probe** project was created as part of the final project for the course ETEC 225 at Centennial College. A logic probe is an essential tool for testing and troubleshooting digital circuits. The aim of this project was to design and fabricate a low-cost, easy-to-use, and safe logic probe that meets all the requirements outlined in the project goals.

## üõ†Ô∏è Project Objectives

- **Inexpensive**: The logic probe is designed to be cost-effective.
- **User-friendly**: The device is handy, portable, and easy to operate.
- **Safe**: High standards of safety were maintained in the design, including neat soldering.
- **Functional**: The probe operates efficiently under various testing conditions.

## üîß Theory of Operation

The logic probe uses two operational amplifiers acting as comparators:

1. **High Voltage Comparator**: Detects high logic levels.
2. **Low Voltage Comparator**: Detects low logic levels.

When the probe is used on a circuit, it compares the input logic level between the comparators. Depending on the voltage, either the high-level or low-level LED lights up, providing a visual and audible indicator of the logic state.

## üìä Experiments & Test Results

During testing, the logic probe met all functional requirements under breadboard conditions. Here are key results:

- **High Logic Threshold**: 2.17V
- **Low Logic Threshold**: 0.93V
- **Current Consumption**: 16.11mA
- **Buzzer Frequency**: 2.7 kHz

All soldering and component placement were verified, and the device performed well in user tests on different breadboards and microcontroller applications.
